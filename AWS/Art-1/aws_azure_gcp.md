|Storage|S3/EBS/EFS/Instance Store|Blob Storage|Object Storage|Amazon Offers 4 types of storage services like EBS, EC2 Instance Store, Elastic File System (EFS) and Simple Storage Service (S3).<br><br>EBS - Amazon EBS provides durable, block-level storage volumes that you can attach to a running instance you can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates  <br><br>Instance Store – Disk storage, which is physically attached to the instance the data on an instance store volume, persists only during the life of the associated instance <br><br>EFS - Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances <br><br>S3 - Amazon S3 provides access to reliable and inexpensive object data storage infrastructure<br>Azure storage provides the following four services: Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and File storage. Blob Storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as Object storage<br><br>Google cloud offers 2 types of storages Persistent Disk and Cloud Storage <br><br>Persistent Disk - Google Persistent Disk is durable and high performance block storage for the Google Cloud Platform. Key features are “Scale without Interruption”, “multi-reader capability” and “Better Snapshot Performance”<br><br>Cloud Storage - Google Cloud Storage is unified object storage |
|Compute|EC2|VM|Compute Engine|Amazon offers Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service which provides scalable computing capacity which is known as EC2 Instance.Similarly Google cloud offers Google Cloud Engine (GCE).<br><br>To create an instance both Amazon & Google cloud offers what variety of instance types which are with different combination of CPU/Memory/Storage capabilities.<br><br>Amazon has wide variety of instance types (~ 45 types) which matches most of the needs whereas Google cloud has fewer instance types (~ 18 types) which may serve the common needs. Additionally Google cloud offers a facility where users can create custom instances with their own of CPU/Memory combinations.<br><br>Azure  has less variety in VM families compared to AWS, but on the other hand, much more flexibility with regards to machine size.<br><br>Its families include general-purpose, optimized machines (better CPU, more RAM and more SSD storage), performance-optimized (even more than “optimized”) and network-optimized (32Gbps Infiniband networking). |
