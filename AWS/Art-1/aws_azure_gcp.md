Amazon Offers 4 types of storage services like EBS, EC2 Instance Store, Elastic File System (EFS) and Simple Storage Service (S3).  

EBS - Amazon EBS provides durable, block-level storage volumes that you can attach to a running instance you can use Amazon EBS as a primary storage device for data that requires frequent and granular updates  

Instance Store – Disk storage, which is physically attached to the instance the data on an instance store volume, persists only during the life of the associated instance  

EFS - Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances  

S3 - Amazon S3 provides access to reliable and inexpensive object data storage infrastructure  

Azure storage provides the following four services: Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and File storage. Blob Storage stores unstructured object data. A blob can be any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as Object storage  

Google cloud offers 2 types of storages Persistent Disk and Cloud Storage   

Persistent Disk - Google Persistent Disk is durable and high performance block storage for the Google Cloud Platform. Key features are “Scale without Interruption”, “multi-reader capability” and “Better Snapshot Performance”  

Cloud Storage - Google Cloud Storage is unified object storage
